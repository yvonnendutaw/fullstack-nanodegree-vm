def all_pairs(lst):
    """Takes a list and generates all the unique pairs it contains.

    The order of the pairs is not important and the ordering of each pair is not important.
    The list must be of even length.

    This function was written by gatoatigrado (Stack Overflow username) and the orginal can
    be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13020502

    I have used this function as it precisely gives me what I wanted, without producing
    excessive repeated pairings for this application.

    Args:
        lst (list): a list of items to be paired up

    Yields:
        list: The next set of pairs. Each pair consists of items from the orginal list placed
            within a tuple.

    Example:
        Here is an example of the output for a list of 4 items.

        >>> for pairs in all_pairs([1, 2, 3, 4]):
                print pairs
        [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
        [(1, 3), (2, 4)]
        [(1, 4), (2, 3)]

        For a list of 4 items, the argument to the itertools.product() function is:
            [0, 1, 2], [0]

        Which will produce the following output from the product() function:
            (0, 0)
            (1, 0)
            (2, 0)

        So these results mean there will be 3 sets of pairs containing 2 pairs each.

        For the first set (0, 0), the pop function is always pop(0) - taking the first
        item off the temp list. So this just produces two pairs in the same order as per
        the original list.

        For set (1, 0), the first pair is (1, 3), as the first item of the first pair is
        always the first item from the original list and the 1 means an item is skipped
        and 3 is selected. The second pair is just what is left, (2, 4).

        For set (2, 0), 2 items are skipped, so the first pair is (1, 4). Then what's left is
        (2, 3) for the 2nd pair.

    """
    # Check to make sure there are an even number of items in the list.
    list_length = len(lst)
